### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Geomarcia Ramos!
##
### ðŸ˜€ About me
- Passionate about technology and the various possibilities to learn!!
- When it comes to Front-end, I use React, I like to think about how to make the logic, reuse components and keep the code organized. 
I research and apply new elements within this library, such as Hooks.
-  I'm currently focused on learning back-end. At the beginning of my back journey, I understood about NodeJS and its famous framework, Express.
- In my free time I like to read, meditate, train weights and connect with friends and family.
- I like teamwork mainly because of the possibility of having different points of view in pursuit of the same goal!
